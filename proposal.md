# Major Project Proposal
Some short description of the project will go here...

I will be trying to make a game similar to head soccer, with many different characters that you can choose from, which will all have different abilities. I will aim to make it a player vs. player game, with different characters that have different abilities. My goal is to refine the looks of the game as well as possibly create different modes, ex. practice mode. Another idea is to create a currency that can be used to upgrade the game.

## Need to Have List
- things that must be completed, more things that you think must exist, etc.

- start screen with character selection
- implementation of score board
- two working nets with boundaries
- working gravity for the ball
- different abilities for each individual character
- keys activate the abilities
- background music


## Nice to Have List
- things to do after done the need to have's: sound effects, better graphics, etc...

- save progress
- single player mode vs. AI (different levels)
- sound effects for different actions
- practice mode: Single Player (shooting at a net)
- mini game: possession game
- coins/currency awarded to player after each game
- store to purchase more upgrades
