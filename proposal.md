# Major Project Proposal
Some short description of the project will go here...
I will be trying to make a game similar to head soccer, with many different characters that you can choose from, which will all have different abilities. 

## Need to Have List
- things that must be completed
- more things that you think must exist
- etc.
- start screen with character selection
- implementation of score board
- two working nets with boundaries
- working gravity
- 


## Nice to Have List
- things to do after done the need to have's
- sound effects
- better graphics
- etc...
- save progress
